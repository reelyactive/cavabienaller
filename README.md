hue-rainbow-loop
----------------

Cycle Philips Hue Lights through the colours of the rainbow.

### Installation and Configuration

Clone this repository then: 

    cd hue-rainbow-loop
    npm install

Ensure the computer and the Philips Hue bridge are on the same network, press the Link button on the bridge and quickly thereafter:

    node huelink

If successful, copy the generated username to the HUE_BRIDGE_USERNAME constant of the __config.js__ file.  The program will use this username to connect and authenticate with the Hue bridge.

### Running from the command line

Using npm:

    npm start

Or alternatively:

    node huerainbowloop

### Running as a systemd service on the Raspberry Pi

Follow the instructions in our [Raspberry Pi Tutorial](https://reelyactive.github.io/diy/pi-suite/#step03) to run as a systemd service, instead using the file __hue-rainbow-loop.service__
